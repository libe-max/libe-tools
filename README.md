# Libé tools

This repository is the home of the "Libé tools" project. It is an entry point for the [back-end](https://github.com/libe-max/libe-tools-back) and the [front-end](https://github.com/libe-max/libe-tools-front) repositories, and has two helper bash scripts, one for starting working on the project (`start.sh`), and the other for preparing the production ready bundle (`prod.sh`).

The 3 repos, [libe-tools](https://github.com/libe-max/libe-tools), [libe-tools-back](https://github.com/libe-max/libe-tools-back) & [libe-tools-front](https://github.com/libe-max/libe-tools-front) share the same commit history until 4caae3db08a5915b385594d1002042b2a3baeddf, after which the project was split into multiple repos.
